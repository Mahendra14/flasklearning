A repository I am using to learn flask macro web framework

I am trying to follow along with NetworkChunk to build a meme website using flask.S
 We are going to get this random meme from a subreddit.

 Variables will be passed through like below:
  - {{subreddit}} - from render_template to the html file that is being rendered
